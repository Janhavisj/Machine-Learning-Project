## Motivation

Everyone’s life revolves around their health. Health refers to a person’s ability to cope up with the environment on a physical, emotional, mental, and social level. Because of the quick speed of our lives, we are adopting many habits that are harming our health. One spends a lot of money to be healthy by participating in physical activities or having frequent health check-ups to avoid being unfit and get rid of health disorders. When we become ill we tend to spend a lot of money, resulting in a lot of medical expenses.

So, an application can be made which can make people understand the factors which are making them unfit, and creating a lot of medical expenses, and it could identify and estimate medical expense if someone has such factors.

## Objective

1. Predict the future medical expenses of subjects based on certain features building a robust machine learning model.
2. Identifying the factors affecting the medical expenses of the subjects based on the model output.

## Description

Health insurance is a type of insurance that covers medical expenses that arise due to an illness. These expenses could be related to hospitalisation costs, cost of medicines or doctor consultation fees. It can be either Mediclaim plan or Critical Illness Insurance plan(Types of health insurance).
No one plans to fall ill or get hurt, but a serious illness can strike anyone at any time. The cost of treating the illness can cause severe financial strain on the savings you have accumulated over time. This means that you might have to compromise on providing your child the best quality education or defaulting on your home loan payments. Today, the cost of medical treatment is continuously rising.
